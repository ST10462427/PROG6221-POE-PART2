How it Works

1. The user is prompted to enter their name, and a welcome message is displayed.
2. The user can then ask questions about cybersecurity, and the chatbot will respond with relevant information and tips.
3. The chatbot uses a dictionary-based approach to match user queries with predefined responses.
4. If the chatbot doesn't understand the user's query, it will display a message asking the user to rephrase their question.

Key Components

- keywordResponses dictionary: maps keywords to predefined responses
- phishingTips array: contains tips and best practices for avoiding phishing scams
- switch statement: used to determine the response based on the user's query

Code Structure

Future Development

- Consider adding more responses to the keywordResponses dictionary and the switch statement to cover more topics.
